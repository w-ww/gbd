Use R to create a heatmap of global and regional distribution of heart failure etiologies in 2019 based on the given data without any warning messages. The heatmap displays the rank of each cause in the specified regions, with the rank numbers filled in each cell. The "Global" location is placed to the left, as requested. The causes are ranked from 1 (highest) to 16 (lowest) according to age-standardized prevalence. The color of rank data is: 1-3 深红色，4-6橙色，7-9 黄色，10-12淡绿色，13-16深绿色. No gap between the y-axis and the heatmap, as well as the x-axis.
